Text from work comes into Twilio phone number which calls to application sms_reply.py
which is set up on an online web server through ngrok. Program confirms the text is offering
a shift and then responds with the shift reference code as long as the shift is of
appropriate type and on accepted days.

Should I get the shift the program automatically sends a text message to my personal number
with the shift details.
